SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT — LAYERING PATTERN

SUBJECT INFORMATION:
[Customer Name], account number [Account Number], [Occupation], customer since [Customer Since], declared income ₹[Stated Income].

SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION:
Analysis of the subject's account activity between [Start Date] and [End Date] reveals a complex layering scheme involving rapid movement of funds through multiple intermediary accounts. A total of [Number] transactions aggregating ₹[Total Amount] were executed within a period of [Time Span] days.

The transaction pattern shows funds being rapidly moved between [Unique Sources] source accounts and [Unique Destinations] destination accounts. The velocity of [Transactions Per Day] transactions per day far exceeds normal business activity for the subject's stated occupation. The transactions follow a cascading pattern characteristic of the placement and layering stages of money laundering, where illicit funds are distanced from their source through multiple intermediate transfers.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
- Transaction network analysis reveals hub-and-spoke topology with centralized flow patterns
- Average per-transaction value of ₹[Average Amount] suggests intentional fragmentation
- Multiple round-trips identified between counterparty accounts
- Velocity analysis indicates HIGH risk classification
- Total throughput of ₹[Total Amount] through the account

ANALYST ASSESSMENT:
The observed layering activity constitutes reasonable grounds for suspicion under the PMLA. The rapid multi-hop fund transfers through numerous counterparties are consistent with money laundering typologies documented by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). An STR should be filed with FIU-IND and the subject's accounts placed under enhanced surveillance.
